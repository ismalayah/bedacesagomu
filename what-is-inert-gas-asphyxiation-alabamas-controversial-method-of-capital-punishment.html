Sennett’s husband, Charles Sennett, a pastor in Alabama, reportedly hired the men to kill his wife over an alleged affair and financial problems. Charles died by suicide before charges were brought against him, <a href=#>AL.com</a> reported. Smith confessed to his role in the crime.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>What is inert gas asphyxiation?</h2><p data-characters=484 data-current-count=484 data-injectable=true>Inert gas asphyxiation, sometimes called nitrogen hypoxia, kills by replacing someone’s oxygen supply with nitrous gas via a mask until the person supposedly falls asleep and effectively suffocates. Some say inert gas asphyxiation is a more humane and painless way for someone to die compared to other methods of capital punishment. According to those who oppose inert gas asphyxiation, however, the approach is too experimental to be sanctioned by the state, according to <a href=#>NPR</a>.</p><p data-characters=219 data-current-count=219 data-injectable=false>The gas used in the inert gas asphyxiation could also pose a threat to witnesses and religious leaders who typically attend state executions, potentially violating the prisoner’s religious liberty, opponents add.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Questions remain about Kenneth Smith’s execution protocol</h2><p data-characters=426 data-current-count=645 data-injectable=true>In advance of Kenneth Smith’s planned execution via inert gas asphyxiation, the state of Alabama released a heavily redacted protocol explaining how it would be carried out concerning Fordham Law School death penalty expert Deborah Denno. “This is a vague, sloppy, dangerous, and unjustifiably deficient protocol made all the more incomprehensible by heavy redaction in the most important places,” Denmo told the <a href=#>AP</a>.</p><p data-characters=256 data-current-count=256 data-injectable=false>According to former Alabama state senator Trip Pittman, who supports the method, “[nitrogen gas] is readily available. It’s 78% of the air we breathe, and [inert gas asphyxiation] will be a lot more humane to carry out a death sentence” (via AP).</p><p data-characters=281 data-current-count=537 data-injectable=true>As of Kenneth Smith’s planned execution in Jan. 2024, inert gas asphyxiation was only approved in two other U.S. states beyond Alabama: <a href=#>Mississippi and Oklahoma</a>. At first, Smith requested inert gas asphyxiation before his failed lethal injection, but that request was denied.</p><p data-characters=366 data-current-count=366 data-injectable=false>At the time of this writing, Smith’s planned execution would be the second attempt in Alabama to carry out the sentence. In 2022, his execution by lethal injection was aborted because a vein could not be located, according to the <a href=#>AP</a>. John Forrest Parker, the other man convicted for Elizabeth’s death, was executed by lethal injection in Alabama in 2010.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekp8KmecKroKadX6y1osCMoqpmoZ6av7V5xpqqZpmjpbW6xMiaq6KnnmKura3BmqSaq12YvK%2FA0aitnqqjnq6tecyeq6GnlGK8p3nCmqeirJGherHBzaKqoaWVo8Fw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
