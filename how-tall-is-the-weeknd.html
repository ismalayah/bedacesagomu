But it seems his past actions don’t seem to knock him down. In fact, his performance at the 2020 MTV VMAs made him look like he was the king of the world. But does he have the height for it?</p><h2 id=h-the-weeknd-s-height-explained data-injectable=false>The Weeknd’s height, explained</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=608 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=339 data-current-count=339 data-injectable=false>Tesfaye was born in Canada on Feb. 16, 1990, and is the only child of an Ethiopian household. During an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rolling Stone</a>, he revealed that he has an estranged relationship with his father and that he was raised by his mother and grandmother. He began his music career in 2009 and eventually became the pop singer we know today.</p><p data-characters=431 data-current-count=770 data-injectable=true>Per his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celeb Heights profile</a>, The Weeknd is 5 feet and 6 inches tall (169.5cm). That is around the average height of an Ethiopian male but is a bit short when it comes to the average height of Canadians, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DrYukselYurttas.com</a>. This makes the R&B artist shorter than his A-list peers in the music world. In comparison, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kanye West</a> has a recorded height of 5 feet and 8 inches and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Justin Bieber</a> is 5 feet and 7 inches.</p><p data-characters=165 data-current-count=165 data-injectable=false>When photographed with his ex-girlfriend, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bella Hadid</a>, The Weeknd is noticeably shorter than his former partner. Hadid has a recorded height of 5 feet and 7 inches.</p><p data-characters=150 data-current-count=315 data-injectable=false>The same can be said for his current partner, Simi Khadra. This DJ and entrepreneur also has the same height as Hadid, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">biographygist.com</a>.</p><p data-characters=184 data-current-count=499 data-injectable=false>Regardless, The Weeknd’s height doesn’t seem to bother him or his love interests, and nor should it. People love him for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">his music and talent</a>, and that is all that matters.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S1sMOMrZilpF2ewG7Ax55ksJ2VoLulew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
