This intergenerational team of champions would have been unstoppable, but unfortunately, they imploded tonight on Monday Night Raw.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=trish-stratus-costs-team-bextreme-their-tag-team-titles>Trish Stratus Costs Team Bextreme Their Tag Team Titles</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/wrestlemania-39-trish-stratus-lita-becky-lynch-win.jpg><p>During a backstage segment on Raw, WWE Women's Tag Team Champion Lita was found injured backstage by Liv Morgan and Raquel Rodriguez. Becky Lynch came over once she heard Morgan and Rodriguez shouting for help.</p><p>Since Liv and Raquel were set to challenge Lita and Becky tonight, their presence backstage seemed very suspicious to Becky. However, Lynch didn't realize that her true enemy was right under her nose. Trish Stratus offered to take Lita's place and defend the Tag Team Championships with Becky, and Becky graciously accepted.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Becky and Trish lost the match with Trish taking the pin. Liv and Raquel promptly left the ring after their victory, leaving Trish and Becky in the ring alone. Becky helped Trish to her feet and the two hugged it out. However, as soon as Becky turned her back, Trish hit her with a forearm shot. All it took then was one kick to the head to leave Becky incapacitated in the ring.</p><p>Later on in the show, Byron Saxton tried to ask Trish Stratus why she turned on Becky Lynch tonight. However, Trish simply walked past him without a word. The WWE universe will just have to wait and see if Trish Stratus ever explains herself.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmekp7a0tIysq6uZpKrAbsDUq6WsZZiasq15zqdkm52ToMZuuNinmqFlp6yybrnOp5uasV2jtqi002apmq9f</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
