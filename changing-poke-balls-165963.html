Honestly, I am convinced that the behavior of the pokeballs only exists for the sake of the game. I just cannot find the justification in my head for there to be a device that is more reliable at catching pokemon than others. I'm not buying that pokemon make themselves available to humans they think are worthy. If that was true, then why the test to prove your worth? Why do you have to fight the poke first to capture them? By using a ball that catches more reliably, you are bypassing said test anyway, and this implies that either the test was BS or you're somehow overriding the pokemon's will. What about pokemon that are just defending themselves? I don't see how that doesn't make you equally vulnerable to a pokeball. It is heavily implied you're supposed to be making friends with your pokemon, yet this exists. I honestly believe that the only reason that these modifiers exist is to make the game easier. To provide a way to catch a specific pokemon should you just be seeking a certain one.<p>Having different kinds of pokeballs is another matter, though. I've seen this kind of idea floating around lately. It's sort of been around since the beginning, to have a pokeball that lets you know either that it's uniquely your own, and/or what's inside of it. It's a neat idea, but it's not one I've seen too much of. Other than that, I like to think all pokeballs should behave pretty much the same. For me, they are little more than a convenience, a way to be able to take pokemon wherever you need them to be. There are some ways that simply keeping them out of a ball would be a hindrance. The complication is simple enough to see, though. By keeping them in a ball, you are more disconnected from them. Not like in ancient times, when they were around their pokemon all the time, and thus developed a closer bond, allowing them to be more effective. In the modern world, though, you can more easily keep track of multiple pokemon. You can even transfer them over great distances at your convenience. I will also say that due to not needing to put in as much effort, that the quality of their performance suffers as well. Much has been sacrificed to make the world more efficient.</p><p>That is not to say that one cannot have the same bond with a pokemon caught in a ball that you would otherwise. No, that is the whole principle behind it. The pokeball is useless without it. A pokemon can freely decide if it wants to leave or not. If you want to believe the anime, they can even freely break out of the pokeball at will. It cannot seal a pokemon that doesn't want to be captured, or at least that is the only way I can justify it. Although, you may find that if you do possess such a bond, then you will spend more time with them out of the pokeball than not.</p><p>I've never truly figured out what goes on in the pokeball, but I like to think it's a pocket dimension. A realm designed for the pokemon's comfort. It simulates the environment most suited to the pokemon in question and provides everything they need. In emergencies, it is a life support device, hopefully keeping it stable enough for you to get it to a pokemon center. It cannot provide companionship, though, or at least realistic companionship. I'd like to think that the pokemon can hang out in each others' "homes", but I'd be unable to tell why exactly a pokeball is letting in more than the pokemon it's been assigned to. Perhaps they can all link up via some kind of pokeball network, I don't know.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorPAq5uepl6jsrV706GpnpmUqHyktMCnnqKml2K9sLfEZpmapJyoe3KClHJtbGc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
