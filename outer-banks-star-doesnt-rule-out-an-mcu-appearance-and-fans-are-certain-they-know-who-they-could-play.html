His response was cryptic, to say the least.</p><p>You know what… we have no idea.</p><p data-characters=292 data-current-count=653 data-injectable=true>Of course, the incredibly vague answer has caught the attention of viewers, with many believing that the actor may already be in talks for a role in the MCU, or at the very least, he has his eye on one. In fact, fans of the actor believe they have already found the perfect character for him.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>He already looks like the perfect Johnny storm and young enough to be him for many years!</p>— DiniSA (@DiniSA121) <a href=#>February 21, 2023</a></figure><p lang=en dir=ltr>RUDY. IF YOU’RE READING THIS. WE ARE ROOTING FOR YOU TO BE JOHNNY 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭</p>— Farhan (@farhan__mehmood) <a href=#>February 21, 2023</a><p data-characters=433 data-current-count=733 data-injectable=true>Pankow definitely has the look and he’s already shown he can play an arrogant and charming character similar to Johnny Storm incredibly well with his performances as JJ and Sam. The cast for the MCU’s Fantastic Four hasn’t been confirmed yet, but we know it’s coming. On top of this, we know that Marvel is searching for younger talent to join the MCU so that they’ll be able to stick around for future films.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=288 data-current-count=288 data-injectable=false>Pankow’s co-star, Gary Weeks, who plays JJ’s father in Outer Banks, also agreed with the fan-casting. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The No Way Home actor championed for Pankow to have a role in the MCU</a> and put forward a better argument than we ever could when he says that Pankow would be perfect for Johnny Storm.</p><p data-characters=409 data-current-count=697 data-injectable=false>We know that Pankow has connections with other MCU alumni as well. He starred alongside Spider-man himself playing <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tom Holland</a>‘s on-screen older brother, Sam Drake, in last year’s movie adaptation of Uncharted. His connection with big players at Marvel Studios may have opened some doors for him with the company so it’s definitely a possibility that we could be seeing him in a superhero role soon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e86uq56qXZeur7fSZqqtmaJisbCx0qerZqqlobJuu9StZJqmXaKwtnnAqaeemaKWu6SxjJqlnWWWlru0ecCrnGablafBorXNZquhnaliuK%2B71mauoaddqbWmxYycpq6klGK9ra3YaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
