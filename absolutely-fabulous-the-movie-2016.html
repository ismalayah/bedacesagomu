It's a focused crowd-pleaser that loves the audience back, even if its comedy is more consistently amusing than laugh-out-loud funny. Director Mandie Fletcher's movie looks like a studio comedy—with some blasé editing goofs to boot—but the film has an inherent energy.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>One of the better transitions from TV series to movie, it has an efficiency for fans and non-fans alike. Devotees of nicknamed "Ab Fab" will see a brighter, unleashed version of their beloved despicable characters, freed from the oppressive laugh tracks and stationary camerawork. But newcomers are equally welcome to appreciate a different kind of arrested development feature comedy, though based on the same values of an Apatow or <a href=#>Adam McKay</a> joint, with even more ridiculousness and subsequent character darkness.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Either camp will face a testing satire of selfishness, and while brash with its un-PC mindset, the film is defined by a good heart. The feature length version of these characters helps to fortify emotional moments, especially between Edina and the woman that's her exact opposite in style and craziness, her daughter Saffy (<a href=#>Julia Sawalha</a>). In an effective shifting of gears later in the film, Saunders (as writer and Edina) delivers a genuine heart-to-heart that deconstructs her character's desperate vanity, expressing the insecurities that we emotionally connect to first before laughing along with her.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Whether joking about the shallowness of the fashion industry or veering to an inverted riff on “<a href=#>Some Like It Hot</a>,” you can never say this romp doesn’t go for it. The "it" may not be as consistently funny as the series, but a few huge laughs in a darkened theater seems to have higher value these days.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46amaynnKrBprjYZp2amqWhvLa%2FjK2fnmWdpMOqsYxrZ2pu</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
