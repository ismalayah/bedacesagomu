Recommended Videos Saying that a Jujutsu Kaisen starts with a flashback doesn‚Äôt typically bode well. Gege Akutami has gotten us way too used to off-screen death scenes recently and with Fumihiko Takaba vs. Kenjaku underway, we can never be too cautious.
In chapter 240, fans got to discover a little bit more about the comedian, as Kenjaku drove him to lose confidence in himself and to question why he even became an entertainer."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Their fight may not be among the best that we‚Äôve seen in Jujutsu Kaisen, but one thing that we can‚Äôt call it is boring. Through this confrontation, the mangaka manages to offer readers just the right mix of humor and character development. In 241, though, things get a little bit darker and more personal.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Jujutsu Kaisen chapter 241 spoilers</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>One of the best JJK chapters in a long time, this made me so emotional seeing Takaba‚Äôs backstory</p><p>I‚Äôll be honest I didn‚Äôt care too much for Takaba before but now he‚Äôs won my heart over.

Even then, the character had a desire to make others laugh in order to connect with them, and for that reason, he tried his best to pursue comedy. The road to achieving that goal wasn‚Äôt easy, though. As an adult, Takaba is often discouraged by his audiences, but even so, there‚Äôs a part of him that refuses to give up.</p><p data-characters=399 data-current-count=399 data-injectable=false>Then, we see Takaba as a child and come to understand that what he wants most is to be known, so that he can make more and more people laugh. As he got older, however, he stopped trying to get out of his comfort zone, re-using the same safe jokes time and again. After this, the flashback comes to an end, and we‚Äôre brought back to the fight against Kenjaku, who gets ready for another attack.</p><p data-characters=483 data-current-count=882 data-injectable=true>Takaba bows down to Kenjaku in an apology for dismissing him before, which stops the antagonist in his tracks as he admires his opponent‚Äôs form. Takaba explains that he intends to make everyone laugh, and that includes Kenjaku, and while doing so, his cursed technique starts re-gaining power, as the sorcerer‚Äôs confidence builds up. The chapter ends with Takaba promising he‚Äôll win this fight, and for everyone‚Äôs sake, we can only hope that he‚Äôs right.</p><h2 id=h-when-and-where-to-read-jujutsu-kaisen-chapter-241 data-injectable=false>When and where to read Jujutsu Kaisen chapter 241</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/jujutsu-kaisen-chapter-239.jpg><p data-characters=532 data-current-count=832 data-injectable=false>No matter how much you may enjoy finding spoilers online, nothing can replace the feeling of looking through the original content once it comes out. As Jujutsu Kaisen <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">draws ever closer to its end</a>, it‚Äôs also vital that fans read the manga chapters in their entirety instead of getting by on spoilers alone. To do so, fans should head to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Manga Plus</a> website or app on Sunday, Nov. 5, at 10am CT. Chapter 241 of Jujutsu Kaisen will be available to read then, with official translations in several languages, including English.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6mmKefkWS3trbUraquZZuWtrSxzWaaoZmgqbKzeZFtaGaroKS2rbHRrGSrnZyarrSxjK2gpp1dlruledahnKudXam8br7Empto</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
