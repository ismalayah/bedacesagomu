The pianos are a sight so impressive, someone decided to put one aboard the sinking 747 from “Airport 77” with the same, crushing results (now, those should have been bolted to the floor!). &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.rogerebert.com/redactor_assets/pictures/5c637971306fcc1f0c82dbf3/content_poseidon-image-3.jpg><p><span class=s1></span>“The Poseidon Adventure” came out at the early stage of the '70s disaster movie era, and even though its successors have become bigger and more technically advanced, it is still the best of the group for a variety of reasons. First and foremost, it's about the only one that deals with more than just a handful&nbsp;of characters stuck in one of its genre’s typical formats, be it the heroic, philandering pilots and brave stewardesses sacrificing themselves for the greater good in the “<a href=#>Airport</a>” movies; the romantic triangles resolved by catastrophe from “Earthquake,” “<a href=#>Titanic</a>” and “Airport 77”; the couples on the brink of divorce whose relationship is saved by the calamity at hand (with the expendable third party usually getting crushed or vanished) in “2012,” “<a href=#>San Andreas</a>” and “<a href=#>Twister</a>”; the parents on a quest to save their offspring from certain doom in “<a href=#>The Day After Tomorrow</a>” and “San Andreas”; or, more often than not, a combination of one or several of these formulas. “The Poseidon Adventure” is a film that cannot be described as a mere roller coaster ride like most of the genre’s recent examples, where the characters are chased by one catastrophe after the other nonstop. It reminds me more of&nbsp;Ridley Scott's 2015 film&nbsp;“<a href=#>The Martian</a>,” with its players having to survive one unexpected setback after the other in order to reach the end of their journey.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmn5miYrOtwc2gZJynoqeytLzOp5uepqSofKm71maroZ1dpby0scidpqdlkZnDprrTrqmeZZekwW65xGafqKebmrFuu81mpKiumZrAbrLOq2SloZaa</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
