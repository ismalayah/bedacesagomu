I will see you again soon from this screen and perhaps from some others, but again, you have and you continue to be the reason why my work is so special, so thank you and God bless you.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=356 data-current-count=656 data-injectable=true>In July, Azuz began a new adventure as the host of his own show, The World from A to Z, a series described as “a current events resource that promotes critical thinking, civil discourse, and compassion in your classroom,” with nine-minute episodes available every weekday throughout the school year.
