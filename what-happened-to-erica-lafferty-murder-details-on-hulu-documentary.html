Dan is now incarcerated in Utah State Prison’s maximum-security institution as of 2022.</p><p>Ron, on the other hand, spent 34 years on death row in Utah. In the year 2019, Ron Lafferty died of natural causes at the Draper facility.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=erica-lafferty-parents-brenda-lafferty-and-allen-lafferty></span>Erica Lafferty Parents: Brenda Lafferty And Allen Lafferty<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Erica Lane Lafferty’s parents Brenda Lafferty and Allen Lafferty were happy to welcome their baby girl into their lives.</p><p>Sadly, the 15 months old, Erica and her mother Brenda were murdered by Allen’s brothers, Ron and Dan Lafferty.</p><p>As per the reports, &nbsp;Ron and Dan were fueled by fundamentalism, delusions of grandeur, and a childhood filled with violence.</p><p>In fact, they became infatuated by polygamy as a religious virtue, and Allen Lafferty succumbed to their sway. Ron got a “vision” from God asking him to “remove” Brenda and Erica as self-proclaimed prophets when Brenda opted to combat the notion for herself.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYlsFutMCpp56mlZl6tbuMnqmim5FiuaKyxZ6prbFdosKzsMSrZJ2dpJa2rb%2BMqKVmoKWhwm6wzpyspp2eqa6zxY4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
