Fans of the show were treated to an explosive finale as the expected reunion between Tiff Der and Mildred Bustillo didn’t go the way anyone planned. The couple, who got engaged on Ultimatum day, revealed they weren’t together anymore. Things got worse from there.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=354 data-current-count=354 data-injectable=false>Why did the couple break up? The relationship was “unhealthy” and “tumultuous,” they both said. Bustillo revealed she was arrested after one of the couple’s fights turned violent, per a recent deep dive on the reunion in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a>, and she admitted to attacking Der with a pet gate. They argued until Der left the set in tears.</p><p data-characters=201 data-current-count=555 data-injectable=true>Der, who uses they/them pronouns, said “It’s so hard to [take] a three-year relationship and try to sum it up to someone that wasn’t a fly on the wall for the last three years.”</p><p data-characters=345 data-current-count=345 data-injectable=false>As for how Der feels about Bustillo, they said “I do wish her nothing but happiness. Obviously, we’re not meant for each other. “I think the way I can best sum up that whole reunion [is] there’s a lot of personal things that have happened within her family and a lot of things that completely go against my morals.”</p><p data-characters=189 data-current-count=534 data-injectable=true>Der also touched on “accusations” they were “financially dependent” on Bustillo, but that the decision to end the relationship was based on Bustillo crossing a line.</p><p data-characters=285 data-current-count=285 data-injectable=false>“My reason of why I left was something that is so much deeper and something part of my core values, and it’s something that I just don’t stand for. I don’t stand for physical violence. I don’t stand for any of that, especially when she has a child.”</p><p data-characters=137 data-current-count=422 data-injectable=true>Der went on to say that if Bustillo wasn’t going to change for her son, then she wasn’t “going to change for me.”</p><p data-characters=258 data-current-count=258 data-injectable=false>“It doesn’t matter what problems you have with the person — if you’re willing to communicate and work together, especially in a non-violent way, I’m all for it, but, unfortunately, that wasn’t the case at all,” Der said.</p><p data-characters=116 data-current-count=374 data-injectable=false>The couple seemed to never get on the same page regardless. Check out this clip of them “communicating.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=674 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Tiff and Mildred teach us that communication 👏 is 👏 everything 👏 <a href=#>#ultimatumqueerlove</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Df1r4xbiOU</a></p>— The Ultimatum (@TheUltimatum) <a href=#>June 5, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=250 data-current-count=250 data-injectable=false>Der said at the reunion they “wasn’t there to give her a smear campaign. I wasn’t there to hurt her. I was there to have peace. I walked away from that relationship months prior to that reunion, been in zero contact with her.”</p><p data-characters=304 data-current-count=554 data-injectable=true>Unfortunately, Der said, there were “still a lot of unresolved feelings” with Bustillo, who Der claims “was out for a smear campaign. She was literally out to try to ruin me. And we’re not the same. I’m very different from that. Hopefully, that shows in the reunion.”</p><p data-characters=73 data-current-count=73 data-injectable=false>The full season of The Ultimatum: Queer Love is streaming on Netflix now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S2bsPArKWtZaSdsrOxjK2mZp%2BZq7JutMSrZJplo6Kyor6MnJimqJGetK9506Kdn2WUmr9usMisn56rXaS7bsHLraCmmaSqum691J6cq2WcpMOmedGerKehn6N6orrDZpyxZZ2euaW%2BxJ1km62jqbatuM5o</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
