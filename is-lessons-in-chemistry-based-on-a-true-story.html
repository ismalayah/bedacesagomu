Recommended Videos After racking up positive early critical reviews, Apple TV’s Lessons in Chemistry is set to debut this week on the streaming service. In this adaptation of the best-selling debut novel by Bonnie Garmus, Brie Larson takes on the role of Elizabeth Zott, a scientifically minded genius who battles sexism in post-war America, from jealous and bigoted colleagues to other women determined to keep her down."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It’s even received high praise from some <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">huge literary names</a>. But is this against the odds tale from real life, or is it complete fiction? Read ahead to find out if Lessons in Chemistry is based on a true story.</p><h2 id=h-is-lessons-in-chemistry-based-on-a-true-story data-injectable=false>Is Lessons in Chemistry based on a true story?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Lewis-Pullman-and-Brie-Larson-as-Calvin-and-Elizabeth-Zott-Lessons-in-Chemistry-Apple-TV-.jpg><p data-characters=582 data-current-count=882 data-injectable=true>The short answer is that no, Lessons in Chemistry isn’t based on a true story. However, several elements of the plot and Elizabeth’s character are based on things that actually happened to author Bonnie Garmus, and there are lots of historical examples of the accomplishments of women being ignored in recent history (like, how we rightfully give a lot of credit to Alan Turing for cracking the enigma code, but seem to ignore the numerous women involved in that project. And the women involved in the early stages of computing. We could go on, but you get the picture).</p><p data-characters=617 data-current-count=617 data-injectable=true>In terms of elements of the story that are taken from Garmus’ life, the writer has confirmed that Zott’s love of rowing, a major throughline in the book, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">stems from her own obsession with the sport</a>. The central idea of a man taking credit for Zott’s work is also borrowed from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Garmus’ time in marketing</a> when a male colleague stole her idea and was rewarded for it. With that said, if you’ve ever been a woman in a professional environment, or if you’re just a man who pays the slightest bit of attention, you’ll know this isn’t an outcome that’s unique to Garmus.</p><p data-characters=705 data-current-count=705 data-injectable=true>The opposition that Zott faces throughout the novel is also very much grounded in reality. Although the suffragettes won the vote in America decades prior to when the novel is set, gender equality was still very much a pipe dream for most women in the States at that point, even though women had proven they could take on every kind of work thanks to their vital efforts during the war. It was the sort of time when Andrew Tate would have been seen as a moderate, and lots of women <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">fighting against equal rights</a>. To put it bluntly, it wasn’t just an uphill struggle to be taken seriously as a woman in academia in those days, but a sheer cliff face — even for someone as seemingly perfect as Zott.</p><p data-characters=211 data-current-count=211 data-injectable=false>Sadly, though, there was no <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Supper at Six cooking show</a>, and Elizabeth Zott wasn’t a real person. Her struggles, however, very much were real, which is something to keep in mind as you enjoy the new series.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yqv4ylnKyrn6PAbrXNZpqhnZ2ewLW%2B2GaZmquVmXqwuoyaZK2qpZp6tMDOq7Bo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
