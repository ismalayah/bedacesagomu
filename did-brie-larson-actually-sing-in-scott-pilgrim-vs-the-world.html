The film was directed by the Three Flavors Cornetto trilogy filmmaker Edgar Wright, whose fast cuts and infectious humor were perfect for the brand. Though it didn’t follow the comic exactly, it was an acceptable adaptation of the books. As Scott (Michael Cera) engages in combat, he also tackles a personal issue; Todd, the ex of Ramona (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), is going out with his ex, Envy. In a brutal reveal that Envy is back in his life, Scott has to watch her band, Clash At Demonhead, outperform him and his band.</p><p data-characters=235 data-current-count=235 data-injectable=false>The song they perform, entitled “Black Sheep,” was recorded by the indie pop band Metric, who contributed to the soundtrack for the film. However, it is Larson who performs the song on film with an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">impressive amount of dance moves</a>.</p><h2 id=h-does-brie-larson-sing-black-sheep data-injectable=false>Does Brie Larson sing “Black Sheep?”</h2><p data-characters=421 data-current-count=656 data-injectable=true>Larson’s prowess in the role of Envy Adam was not only convincing, but completely accurate. Though Metric recorded the song for the soundtrack, Larson’s voice is in the movie. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Wrap</a>, a big source of discourse in the Scott Pilgrim community was the oversight in not including Larson’s version on the final soundtrack. In recent years, that has finally been rectified, as Wright celebrated on Twitter.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>On July 9th, the Scott Pilgrim Original Motion Picture Soundtrack Expanded Edition will be available on all digital music services!

The actor has musical talents in addition to acting, but that shouldn’t come as a surprise. Before she was a juggernaut in pop culture that she is now, Larson herself was a pop star. Admittedly, she was not on the level as Envy Adams, but she did have her own single, which Larson happily tweeted out as a reminder.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=zxx dir=ltr><a href=#>https://t.co/DQcGTtNQMn</a> <a href=#>https://t.co/iB9pmftrZ6</a></p>— Brie Larson (@brielarson) <a href=#>July 21, 2021</a></figure><p data-characters=639 data-current-count=939 data-injectable=false>Entitled “She Said,” the pop jam highlights the Captain Marvel actor’s vocals that made her an obvious choice to play Envy. This tidbit faded into general obscurity as Larson became a more serious actor. Larson’s filmography is impressive and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">proves all the haters wrong</a>. After appearing in the indie powerhouse film Short-Term 12, she would later receive critical acclaim for&nbsp;Room, and that was all before she made it to the Marvel sphere. It is a one-of-a-kind actor who gets famous for many different avenues, but clearly, Larson is deserving of her fame. Unlike Envy, who just kicked Scott in the heart until it burst.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJom6KcXZe%2FqrGMpZirq5%2BjeqKv066YpaSpYsCqusZmoKdlo5i8tcCMqaCln6Keum7C0maroZ1drLyzuMNo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
