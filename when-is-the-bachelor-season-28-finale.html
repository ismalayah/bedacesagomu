Recommended Videos Joey Graziadei, a fan favorite from season 20 of The Bachelorette, steps into the spotlight for the latest season. He’s set to make connections with 32 women, including a set of sisters and an NFL cheerleader, throughout the early 2024 season. Typical seasons of The Bachelor stretch between 11 and 12 episodes, which leaves fans with a good few months of viewing before the latest season concludes."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Graziadei, a tennis teacher and Ike Kuluz ambassador at The Club at Kukuiʻula in Hawaii, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">already has a fan base baked in</a>. He was a fast favorite in season 20 of The Bachelorette, as he fought to win Charity Lawson’s hand.</p><p data-characters=362 data-current-count=645 data-injectable=true>Graziadei didn’t manage to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">beat out the competition</a> in Lawson’s season of The Bachelorette, but he did finish the season as runner-up. He barely lost out to Dotun Olubeko, and ABC wasted no time in tapping him for a return. He’s already taking the fandom by storm as season 28 digs its nails in, and preps viewers for their new 2024 obsession.</p><p data-characters=383 data-current-count=383 data-injectable=false>Season 28 of The Bachelor is set to last right around two months, stretching from that Jan. 22 debut to late March. Assuming it follows in the form of past seasons, and sports between 10 episodes (the number of episodes in the last season of The Bachelorette) and 12 episodes (the typical length of a Bachelor season), we should have at least two full months of viewing ahead of us.</p><p data-characters=355 data-current-count=738 data-injectable=true>If the season is a touch shorter, and mimics the length of The Bachelorette‘s 20th season, we’ll be seeing episode 10 — the season 28 finale — on March 25. Should it stretch for a few additional episodes, and come in at that typical Bachelor length, we’ll be seeing episode 11 air on April 1, and the finale a week later on April 8.</p><p data-characters=85 data-current-count=85 data-injectable=false>Check out our take on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">who’s most compatible for this hunk</a> in our full run-down.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMSnZKKrXam1pnnBmpqhnZykv26%2FxJqqqKZdZ4VussinmKWdXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
