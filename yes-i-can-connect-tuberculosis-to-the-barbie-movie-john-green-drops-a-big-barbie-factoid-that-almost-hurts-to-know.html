The disease was heavily romanticized in the 19th century for both men and women. For men, it was seen as a propeller to becoming a creative genius. For women, it shrank the body, defined facial structure, and made skin very pale.</p><p data-characters=195 data-current-count=507 data-injectable=true>Because of this, corsets and hourglass figures became very in style. Women were even discouraged from spending time outdoors and engaging in physical activity that would make them bulky or toned.</p><p data-characters=114 data-current-count=114 data-injectable=false>These same beauty features were seen in the original Barbie Doll because of the tuberculosis-era beauty standards.</p><p data-characters=203 data-current-count=317 data-injectable=false>Commenters were just horrified and impressed by the relation, finding the series both fascinating and completely unhinged. Green commented back with absolute confidence that he can relate anything to TB.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmejpLCqrctmpJ6cmZZ8urHSZqBmm5GjeqS7zaecnKxdqcKjsdGcrKWno57AbsDOZquhnV2XrrOuyJ5kpqemnrJuts6hpWafopqyr3nDq6apq12WeqO1xmaZmqqSnrJussCcq6ihlGLBqa3TZpilpZ%2BowW601KurrGWkpHqsus6wZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
