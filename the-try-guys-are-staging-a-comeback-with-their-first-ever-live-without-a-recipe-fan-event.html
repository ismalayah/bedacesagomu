Recommended Videos Case in point: the Guys announced a live finale of their incredibly popular YouTube show “Without a Recipe” using multi-cams and with help from “global interactive video technology company, Kiswe.”
The Guys will make Churros for the live episode, but there are going to be five episodes leading up to it, which include “pop tarts, hamburgers, tacos, boba, and illusion cakes."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

During the live finale, fans will be able to vote on the winner!”</p><p data-characters=309 data-current-count=309 data-injectable=false>The livestream will cost $19.99 for a standard viewing experience and up to $49.99 for a VIP package that comes with a T-shirt. The three remaining Try Guys, Keith Habersberger, Zach Kornfeld, and Eugene Lee Yang also recently spoke with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Hollywood Reporter</a> about the endeavor and the group’s future.</p><p data-characters=160 data-current-count=469 data-injectable=true>They said they’re “doing well” after the whole debacle (which was even <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">parodied by SNL</a>) and that they’re focused on what’s ahead.</p><p data-characters=208 data-current-count=208 data-injectable=false>“We’re excited about what we are making, what we have our sites on for the future. Look — it was a destabilizing few months, but we found our footing and are working on cool things and happy.”</p><p data-characters=128 data-current-count=336 data-injectable=false>While they’re down a member, they said it’s not necessarily about the number of Try Guys and more about the content.</p><p>“Maybe it’s less specific to just the three of us. At the heart of it, our show is about people experiencing things they have never experienced before. [It’s about] having an open mind and having a fun time doing it, and being OK to fail at it. I think as long as that ethos and message goes on through our content, the Try Guys being Keith, Zach and Eugene is less important than the Try Guys being a cast of people that helps other people learn about other people.”</p><p data-characters=286 data-current-count=286 data-injectable=false>Habersberger said they “didn’t really ever anticipate” the level of fame they have now and that when the SNL thing happened never believed they were “important enough to be ridiculed that way.” Now they just hope the negative attention is coming to an end.</p><p data-characters=56 data-current-count=342 data-injectable=false>As for the livestream, the trio promised something huge.</p><p data-characters=114 data-current-count=456 data-injectable=true>“We’re doing something very broadcast television [caliber] on our own, and it’s really exciting.”</p><p>“We want it to not feel like content. Content online is something that passes through you. You watch it, you forget it. It’s fun, it’s fine. We’ve made content for a long time out of necessity. But as we look forward to the future, I think it’s time to really focus in on what we do best and what makes us happiest — just making these high-tier shows.”</p><p data-characters=85 data-current-count=462 data-injectable=false>The Try Guys: Without A Recipe LIVE! airs Dec. 17 at 7pm.
