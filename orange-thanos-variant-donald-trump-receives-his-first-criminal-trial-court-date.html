More than anything, it is their claims of “election interference” that reveal them as humorously hypocritical, considering election interference is one of the charges Trump faces in a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">completely separate criminal trial</a>.</p><p data-characters=520 data-current-count=520 data-injectable=true>That trial has been put on hold, pending Supreme Court considerations of Trump’s claims of presidential immunity, but the case regarding hush money paid to Stormy Daniels is officially on, and Merchan isn’t budging. He likewise brushed aside Trump lawyer Todd Blanche’s complaints about the trial date, after noting that Blanche himself suggested a mid-March start. Blanche himself noted that starting in March would “minimize disruption,” since few primaries are scheduled for the month.</p><p data-characters=404 data-current-count=404 data-injectable=false>This will serve as Trump’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">first official criminal case</a>, followed by the still-pending election interference case, a federal case examining whether Trump mishandled sensitive documents and attempted to conceal them from investigators, and a final case examining claims of election interference specifically in Georgia.
