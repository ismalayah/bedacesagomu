After the various STD tests, the doctor said sympathetically, ‘You gotta start looking after yourself’.</p><p>“I believed what he meant was, ‘This could have been prevented if you weren’t hanging out with a drug dealer’,” she added. “It would seem that the responsibility was on me and for this reason, I didn’t tell anyone and I didn’t report it. I was ashamed because I believed that what had happened to me as a result of having very little self-worth, that this was what happens to drug addicts.”</p><p>In her lengthy message, the 33-year-old also railed against the people in her life who told her to take her alleged rape as a sign to change her life and get sober and clean.</p><p>“This is wrong,” she continued. “My rape had nothing to do with my choices. Drug dealers don’t rape people any more than a family man does. The rehab counselors didn’t correct that belief. My own mother didn’t correct it. F— anyone who meant well but told me to look at this ‘as a sign’ that I needed help…”</p><p>Actresses Sarah Hyland and Busy Philipps also opened up about past teen rape incidents they had buried as they watched Dr. Ford’s testimony against Kavanaugh.</p><p>Hyland revealed she was assaulted by a friend at a high school New Year’s Eve party, while Philipps posted a photo of herself at 14 and revealed the picture was taken shortly after she was raped.</p><p>Both stars posted their truths using the hashtag #WhyIDidntReport, which sexual assault survivors began circulating last week to share their stories after U.S. leader Donald Trump attacked Blasey and questioned why she didn’t come forward with her accusations against Kavanaugh earlier.</p><p><strong>Adopted from: The Province</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3C8xKinpZ1fn7KutcyaZKShoqCybq7IqJ6rmaCdxqKzxKSgnaugp7KousCnq2aZnpl6pbXVqKmcnV8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
