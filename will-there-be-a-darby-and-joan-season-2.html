Since then, fans have been eagerly awaiting an update on its renewal status.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=616 data-current-count=616 data-injectable=true>Darby and Joan first hit the British-American video streaming service Acorn TV on Aug. 8, 2022, and ran for the whole month, concluding its final episode on Aug. 29. The eight-part series was created by Glenys Rowe and Phillip Gwynne, two revered Australian authors. The series was hailed as a breath of fresh air filled to the brim with treasured Aussie actors and actresses. It centers on the adventures of two lone strangers on a road trip: a retired Australian policeman who travels alone with his dog and a widowed English nurse. The two meet and go on an epic journey through northern Australia’s desert.</p><p data-characters=415 data-current-count=415 data-injectable=true>Despite not having any explicit content, the series’ high entertainment value made it a huge hit among adults. The audience was captivated by the on-screen connection between Greta Scacchi and Bryan Brown, who played Joan Kirkhope and Jack Darb, respectively. The series’ huge fan base is itching to see the two on screen together again, but is Darby and Joan season 2 even on the network’s plans?</p><h2 id=h-is-darby-and-joan-season-2-happening data-injectable=false>Is Darby and Joan season 2 happening?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=446 data-current-count=746 data-injectable=true>The murder-mystery comedy-drama aired its two-episode finale to the first season on Aug. 29, 2022, and the series has been on the waitlist for a renewal at Acorn TV ever since. Produced by CJZ, Darby and Joan was funded in part by a production investment from Screen Australia through Screen Queensland. Surprisingly enough, despite the positive reception from fans and critics, Darby and Joan season 2 still hasn’t been given the go-ahead.</p><p data-characters=376 data-current-count=376 data-injectable=false>However, producers definitely have various angles to pursue to move the series forward. The first season finale revealed that Joan’s husband Ian, who was said to have died in Spain, was actually murdered in Australia by an enigmatic man from Jack’s past. She also discovers Ian’s role in a drug smuggling network and his secret life for the first time in the finale.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=676 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=411 data-current-count=411 data-injectable=true>The next season could see Joan and Jack uncovering more mysteries and exploring their feelings for each other. While Joan is now face-to-face with the truth about her husband, Jack has yet to deal with his own troubled past. If season 2 happens, fans can anticipate the return of Bryan Brown and Greta Scacchi journeying across the northern territory of Australia, navigating their personal lives along the way.</p><p data-characters=315 data-current-count=315 data-injectable=false>So far, Darby and Joan season 2 has neither been confirmed nor canceled. Various Australian shows take years between the release of new seasons, but usually only end after the initial season. Even if the network decides to move forward with the idea, season 2 of Darby and Joan may not air until 2024 or even later.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tculZK2glaeybq7EZphmnJGnr7p5wKebZqKflrtuv8SaqqimXWd8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
