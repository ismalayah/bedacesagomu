Is Dance Moms a scripted show? While none of the alums have explicitly declared that Dance Moms is scripted, several have confirmed the fact that what is portrayed on film is not how things genuinely are."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The moms have a phony quarrel every now and then. They just start discussing and laughing about it after that.”</span></p><h2>The Real Story of Dance Moms</h2><p><span>Payton Ackerman, like Dolph Ziggler, has spoken out about it. She recounted how she ended up on the show in a video posted on her YouTube page.</span></p><p><span>Ackerman explained that she was at a facility for a dance class when people from the show invited her and her mother to return so they could film the Lifetime reality show.</span></p><p><span>But, because Ackerman and her mother had driven for an hour to get to her class. Her mother refused and became irritated.</span></p><p><span>“She went downstairs and opened the studio door…” and began to sound like it was going off,” she recalled. “She was like, ‘You’re not going to spend my money, you’re not going to waste my time, you’re not going to waste her time.”</span></p><p><span>Throughout the incident, there was a cameraman behind Ackerman’s mother who “liked the drama.” </span><span>The next day, Ackerman and her mother were invited to film an episode of Dance Moms. </span><span>Several other alums have also stated that, while not everything mentioned on the show was true, folks did mean every word they uttered at times.</span></p><p><span>In the aforementioned video, Ackerman also discussed how her representation on the show had harmed her real-life image.</span></p><p><span>When she competed in the first episode, the producers asked her if she believed she did better than the other participants (the other groups).</span></p><h2>Ackerman concurred</h2><p><span>However, when the show aired on television, it was manipulated to make it appear. As if she made the statement about the other girls she was dancing with.</span></p><p><span>“Everyone who saw the episode after that hated me,” she explained. “The show’s females turned on me. In preparation for the show. My mother was turned against by the other mothers. It was really a crazed shambles.”</span></p><p><span>The abuse she got lasted until she finished filming for the show. People were ringing her house phone in the middle of the night. And several were knocking on her family’s front door.</span></p><p><span>Her situation had deteriorated to the point that she had received death threats. </span><span>However, this isn’t the only topic on which the show’s alumni have spoken out.n </span><span>Many others have also commented on how aggressively Abby Lee Miller, the show’s dancing instructor, shouted at them, suggesting that her behavior was even worse off camera.</span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Dance Moms</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Dance Moms tv</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGigrGWUlruksYympqarXZZ6tK%2FRoqetnZRiwKm71mg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
