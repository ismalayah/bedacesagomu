Well, not quite. Although a commoner, Kate Middleton’s finances – or at least those of her family – are what many a middle-class Brit would aspire to. Her parents Carole and Michael have built up a comfortable cash pile from a successful online party business, Party Pieces – established in 1987.</p><p>It is a mail order business that aims to help parents create ‘magical’ parties for their children at home. Party Pieces is run from a call centre, with eight staff, out of a barn near Reading in Berkshire. It also has a website which attracts around 150,000 potential customers a month.

[Update 25/11: There is no mortgage on the flat, according to Land Registry records.</p><p>At the age of 28, the future Queen of England, has rather a thin CV for a bright A grade Marlborough educated pupil who earned a 2:1 in History of Art from St Andrew’s University.</p><p><strong>Kate Middleton’s parents:</strong> Mike and Carole Middleton</p><p>Until recently she was working for the family firm after a brief post-graduate foray into the outside world working for retailer Jigsaw.</p><p>Now that her family is to be the Royal variety, she need never worry about money again – if indeed she ever did. As consort to Prince William she will surely be looked after in the manner she has been hoping to become accustomed to since she first met her Prince at St Andrew’s. The new level of wealth is seen from the start with the ring she’s wearing – Diana’s engagement ring – worth a cool £85,700.</p><p>Since the age of 25, Prince William (now 28) has enjoyed a lavish income from the £6.5m capital left to him by his mother Princess Diana, plus money from the estate of his great-grandmother the Queen Mother who died in 2002.</p><p>He also earns a decent salary as an officer in the RAF – a flight lieutenant earns £37,170 a year – and is given an allowance from his father from his own income from the Duchy of Cornwall estate. And should his father pre-decease him, his income will go stratospheric when the whole of that income is transferred to him.</p><h2><span style=text-decoration:underline>The World’s Richest Royals 2011</span></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKORqbJuucidm6WdpKS7tHnFmqSipKmoeqO1zqCpmqiYrnqnrcKtZJyZopqys3nAsJirnKNiu6bAjLCmq6yYYrmqssRmqq2noq58</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
