Judging from promotional pictures at least, we’ll see the end of Rebels one again. In the original, Ahsoka appears in a fancy white robe before Sabine Wren, but in the Disney Plus version she’s in her usual grey gear. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Redditors want to know what’s going on</a>:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=681 data-injectable=true><a href=#>Are they retconning Ahsoka the white in her new show?</a><br>by<a href=#>u/Ozzieoz06888</a> in<a href=#>StarWars</a></figure><p data-characters=412 data-current-count=412 data-injectable=true>The top-voted comment comes in with a predictable but well-executed The Lord of the Rings reference, saying “Can’t get Ahsoka the white til she’s fought off a Balrog, died and been resurrected to finish her duty.” To be fair, she’s clearly trying to pull off the whole Gandalf thing in her white robe, and it is a little curious they’ve quietly retconned this for live-action.</p><p data-characters=97 data-current-count=97 data-injectable=false>Back in 2018, Filoni was adamant in an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CBR </a>that the white robe was very important.</p><p>“Her entire look is important. It’s very important. It’s specific to her journey prior to seeing her at the end of&nbsp;Rebels. … I designed it a certain way with [art director] Kilian Plunket. People are already trying to guess ‘Is it just a staff? Is it some kind of saber staff?’ That would be exciting. We’ll have to see. But the image of her, everything about it was important. Even the inclination of her head, where her jawline was.”</p><p data-characters=295 data-current-count=295 data-injectable=false>Five years ago, we doubt Filoni ever thought he’d be steering a big budget live-action Ahsoka show, and perhaps what works in animation just doesn’t work as an actual costume. Plus, we’d much rather have twin lightsabers Ahsoka Tano than one wielding some kind of mystic staff.</p><p data-characters=123 data-current-count=418 data-injectable=true>Maybe these robes will appear in the show in some form, but from where we’re standing, we can get behind this retcon.</p><p data-characters=67 data-current-count=67 data-injectable=false>Ahsoka episodes one and two will premiere on Disney Plus on Aug 23.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yiec%2Boq56mpJ6urXnAoaqoo5Fiv6bAwqilZqegmru0edOhnGacn6S%2FtHnTqGSsrJGnerit0axkrK2gpbyzwMSrqmaflanBqrrGZquhnZmneqetza2YrLFdobyzsYycpqeepaiypXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
