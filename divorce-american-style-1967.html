They started out low on the economic ladder, struggled for years and, now that Van Dyke is pulling down $35,000, it turns out they have nothing to talk about. A vague discontent begins to stir. They give a party and afterward, exhausted, start a fight that ends ominously in silence.</p><p>The scene that follows can honestly be described as a classic. The two go into their bedroom and angrily begin to get ready for bed -- without a word spoken. Using split-second timing, they move around the room, opening and shutting drawers, sliding closet doors back and forth, brushing their teeth, hanging up their clothes -- all in total silence but perfect coordination. They can't break out of this nightly routine, practiced for 17 years, even though they want to.</p><p>Once the marriage seems on the rocks, advocates of divorce appear. There is a family counselor with a twinkle in his eye for Debbie, lots of vindictive friends who advise immediate separation and two lawyers more interested in their golf games than the partners of the marriage.</p><p>There are a few fumbling attempts at reconciliation, but they come to nothing because Dick and Debbie can't bring themselves to discuss their difficulties. The last, disastrous, note is sounded when he nibbles her ear and she says, "Don't kiss me like a chipmunk."</p><p>When the divorce becomes final, Van Dyke, subsisting on $87.50 a week after alimony, moves into a motel room and meets another divorced man (<a href=#>Jason Robards</a>) who takes him home to meet his ex-wife (<a href=#>Jean Simmons</a>). Robards, you see, needs a leg operation, but he'll have to keep limping until he marries off Miss Simmons and frees himself of alimony payments. But Van Dyke can't marry on $87.50 a week. And Debbie, fixed up by friends with a millionaire bachelor auto dealer (played with droll humor by <a href=#>Van Johnson</a>), finds him good company but -- well, not husband material.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46doK%2Bnopiybq3Mnqmim5GjerTA2KWcZmlpa4Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
