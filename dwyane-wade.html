Wade had received the second-most fan votes for guards in the Eastern Conference. On April 9, Wade played his last home game in Miami, scoring 30 points. In his final game the following night, Wade recorded his fifth career triple-double with 25 points, 11 rebounds, and 10 assists.</p><p>In 2019, Wade appeared as a guest judge on season 14 of America's Got Talent alongside wife Gabrielle Union.</p><p>On February 8, 2018, at the NBA trade deadline, the Cavaliers overhauled their roster. Acquiring guards <a href=#>Jordan Clarkson</a>, <a href=#>George Hill</a>, <a href=#>Rodney Hood</a> and <a href=#>Cedi Osman</a>, the Cavaliers traded Wade back to the Miami Heat in exchange for a protected 2024 second-round draft pick. At the funeral of Wade's long-time agent Henry Thomas in January, Wade mended relations with Riley. On February 9, in his first game, Wade was garnered a standing ovation and came off the bench in a 91–85 win over the Milwaukee Bucks.

On offense, he was one of the quickest and most difficult players to guard, as well as one of the best slashers in NBA history. Wade's signature one-two step allowed him to dash past bigger defenders and draw fouls. Wade ranked first in free-throw attempts per 48 minutes in 2004–05 and again in the 2006–07 season. Wade was an unselfish player, averaging 5.4 assists for his career.

He helped bring the Golden Eagles to the Final Four for the first time since their 1977 national championship season. Wade was subsequently named to the All-America First Team by the Associated Press (AP), making him the first basketball player from Marquette to receive the distinction since 1978.</p><p>Selected fifth in the 2003 NBA draft by the Miami Heat, Wade became the highest ranked of only four Marquette first round draft picks. Wade quickly emerged as a productive player, averaging 16.2 points on 46.5% shooting as well as 4 rebounds and 4.5 assists. After a 5–15 start, the Heat gradually improved to finish 42–40 and qualify for the playoffs. Wade served up outstanding postseason performances, particularly against the Indiana Pacers during the Eastern Conference Semifinals. Wade earned a unanimous selection to the 2004 NBA All-Rookie Team and finished third in rookie of the year voting (after LeBron James and Carmelo Anthony). He placed among the top five rookies in several statistical categories, including second in field goal percentage, second in steals, third in scoring, fourth in assists, and fourth in minutes played.</p><p>Wade turned to basketball and football, avoiding the temptations of drugs and gangs. Wade credited Tragil as the person most responsible for pointing him in the right direction. Wade grew up idolizing Michael Jordan and modeled his game after him. On October 14, 2001, as Wade's basketball career blossomed, JoLinda vowed to turn her life around. She says that she has not used drugs since 2003.</p><p>Wade is a Christian and chose the number 3 throughout most of his career because it represents the Holy Trinity. He tithes 10% of his salary to a church in Chicago. His mother, Jolinda, strengthened her ties to Christianity in 2001 after years of drug problems. She served as a minister during her final prison sentence in 2002 and 2003. She was ordained as a Baptist minister in January 2007 and formed the non-denominational Temple of Praise Binding and Loosing Ministry in Chicago. In May 2008, Wade purchased a church building for his mother's ministry.</p><p>Dwyane Tyrone Wade Jr. (/d w eɪ n / dwayn; born January 17, 1982) is an American former professional basketball player.

Wade described his early childhood in the South Side of Chicago as trying.</p><p>Wade's nicknames include D-Wade and Flash, which was given to him by former teammate Shaquille O'Neal who would sing, "He's the greatest in the Universe", in reference to the Queen song of the same name from the 1980 film Flash Gordon.
