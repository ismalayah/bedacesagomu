However, she has also competed in beauty pageants, earned a doctorate degree, worked as a physical therapist, worked as a yoga instructor, published a book, and starred in a movie — is there anything she can’t do?</p><h2 data-injectable=false>From Miss Virginia USA to assistant professor, there’s nothing Desi can’t do</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Dr. Desi Williams, DPT | Lifestyle | Adventure | Fitness (@desijwilliams)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=411 data-current-count=711 data-injectable=true>As for her history within the beauty pageant world, Desi served as Miss Virginia USA in 2016. Aside from that monumental victory, she won several other titles, including Miss Virginia in 2013 (competing in the 2014 Miss America Pageant), National Sweetheart 2012, and Miss Hampton University 2011. With a face like that, we are not surprised that Desi has received so much recognition for her undeniable beauty!</p><p data-characters=364 data-current-count=364 data-injectable=false>With her good looks aside, Desi is also a brainiac, contrary to popular belief. When asked about her personal claim to fame in her biography for Survivor: Heroes vs. Healers vs. Hustlers, she shared that she “became an assistant professor at the age of 26 and a program director at the age of 27. They don’t just hand out those titles to anyone.”</p><p data-characters=488 data-current-count=852 data-injectable=true>To top it all off, Desi is a proud Black woman, supporting the Black Lives Matter movement on her various social media platforms, as well as being involved in quite a few other projects. The Georgia native wrote a book&nbsp;with Heather A. Worthy titled Love Affair With My Hair: Why Black Women Cheat On Health, ultimately adding the words published author to her resume. In addition to this, Desi acted in a film&nbsp;titled Blindfire, which tackled the issue of racism within law enforcement.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Desi’s love life and social media updates</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Dr. Desi Williams, DPT | Lifestyle | Adventure | Fitness (@desijwilliams)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=225 data-current-count=525 data-injectable=true>With her various accomplishments aside, Desi uses her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram account</a> (which has amassed nearly 30k followers) to share aspects of her personal life, including her relationship with her oh-so handsome fiancé, Jeremy Laney.</p><p data-characters=210 data-current-count=210 data-injectable=false>“He brought me to my favorite place 📍 to do my favorite thing 🍷 and then bribed me with a diamond 💍 Obviously, YES 🥰🥰🥰,” she wrote in an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram post</a> announcing their engagement.</p><p data-characters=737 data-current-count=947 data-injectable=true>“One year later and we still want to get married, so I’d say that’s something to celebrate… About 30 minutes before Jeremy proposed, I figured out the plan, location, etc. based upon some ‘casual conversation’ our driver and Jeremy were having.
