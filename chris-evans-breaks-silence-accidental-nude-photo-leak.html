No, instead, Evans and the role that made him a household name were trending because he accidentally shared a nude photo, which understandably sent the internet into a meltdown.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=495 data-current-count=495 data-injectable=true>It all started with an innocent game of Heads Up, which Evans was playing with his 5.7 million Instagram followers. But after “failing to trim a clip from a video he uploaded,” he accidentally shared a gallery of some very private photos, including one extremely revealing nude pic. It didn’t show the person’s face, but it was clearly Evans and though it was deleted soon after, more than enough people managed to take a screengrab, with the photo quickly spreading around social media.</p><p data-characters=245 data-current-count=245 data-injectable=false>In the days since, a number of Evans’ colleagues have weighed in with some hilarious takes – <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">including Mark Ruffalo</a> – and now, the actor himself has broken the silence with a pretty perfect reply, which you can check out below.</p><p data-characters=270 data-current-count=515 data-injectable=true>https://twitter.com/ChrisEvans/status/1305681183129436161?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1305681183129436161%7Ctwgr%5Eshare_3&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcomicbook.com%2Fmarvel%2Fnews%2Fchris-evans-photo-leak-twitter-reaction-vote-captain-america%2F</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/EaZofrgXkAI-Y_e.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/EaZofrgWAAE11aE.jpeg><p data-characters=339 data-current-count=339 data-injectable=false>Short and sweet, then, and frankly, he played it very well. Nothing more really needs to be said, anyways. After all, these sorts of things usually die out by themselves and it won’t be long before some other celebrity takes the spotlight from Evans for doing something foolish. Not to mention it also could’ve been much worse.</p><p data-characters=273 data-current-count=612 data-injectable=false>In any case, we don’t expect&nbsp;<strong>Chris Evans&nbsp;</strong>to say much more on the matter than the tweet above and already, the commotion is beginning to subside. Besides, like he mentions here, there are more important issues to focus on, like the upcoming election on November 3rd.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomqGqmah6psLAp6pmmqKarqy%2FjKygpZ2emLJurcKcoJ2dnqmurXnNrpueZaCdvLW7jKWcmqNf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
