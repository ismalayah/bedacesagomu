The former child actor is one of Hollywood’s hardest workers, having made it in the tough industry despite having no connections. After a couple of breakthrough performances in Polar Express and Bridge to Terabithia, he shot to global success in The Hunger Games. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">A vocal ally of the LGBTQ+ community</a>, he’s also had plenty of television experience, including playing the lead role in the Hulu series Future Man. However, it’s his film work that he’s really well known for, and what we’ll be writing about today.</p>Recommended Videos<h2 id=h-10-red-dawn data-injectable=false>10. Red Dawn</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=654 data-current-count=954 data-injectable=true>You’d think with a well-trained superstar in Chris Hemsworth in the lead role, you’d at least get a great action film, but this remake of the 1984 movie was a bit of a mess. If we’re honest, Hutcherson was one of the only believable parts in it. Red Dawn follows a newly formed militia who are fighting for their lives after a surprise North Korean invasion. The plot is already stretching believability to the point of breaking, but it really isn’t helped by poor writing and cheap-looking special effects. However, in the role of Robert, Hutcherson at least makes sense, giving a compelling performance in a sea of incredulity.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>9. Escobar: Paradise Lost</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=603 data-current-count=903 data-injectable=true>Hutcherson starred and executive produced this thriller about a surfer who falls in love with a Colombian woman, only to discover she’s the niece of infamous drug lord Pablo Escobar. Although there are scenes of real heart at the beginning of the film, as the plot unfurls everything gets a whole lot darker, especially as Hutcherson’s character, Nick, becomes the target of Escobar’s wrath and has to hide. Although at parts Escobar: Paradise Lost loses momentum and credibility, Hutcherson and his fellow male lead, Benicio del Toro (Escobar) sparkle, making this well worth a watch.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>8. The Disaster Artist</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=855 data-current-count=1155 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Disaster Artist chronicles the making</a> of The Room, a cult-classic that’s widely considered to be one of the worst movies ever made. Starring <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">James and Dave Franco</a>, the dramedy captures the absurdity of the film and its legendarily insane filming process, as well as the quirks and strangeness of the mysterious writer, director, producer, and star of The Room, Tommy Wiseau (James Franco). If you’re a fan of the terrible yet fiercely loved comedy, then you’ll definitely enjoy the film, and even if you’ve never had the misfortune of seeing Wisseau’s butt writhing on screen in one of the many needlessly gratuitous sex scenes, it’s still worth a watch. Hutcherson is especially funny as Philip Haldiman, who plays the innocent addict Denny in The Room, and always manages to get a laugh when he’s on screen.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>7. Epic</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=819 data-current-count=1119 data-injectable=true>Hutcherson’s acting talents translate perfectly into voiceover work as shown by his great performance in this <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">engaging computer animated adventure story</a>. Adapted from the 1996 children’s book The Leaf Men and the Brave Good Bugs, it follows a teen named Mary Katherine (M.K, played by Amanda Seyfried), who is shrunk and teleported into a minuscule woodland kingdom to help the residents fight off an evil power. Beautiful to look at, emotion in all the right spots, and a few laughs along the way: Epic is a great watch for all ages, and Hutcherson does great work as Nod, the love interest and a rookie warrior known as a Leafman, who protects the forest from the evil creatures known as Boggans. Even though it’s a voice role, the chemistry between his character and Seyfried’s is undeniable.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>6. Detention</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=877 data-current-count=1177 data-injectable=true>A dark slasher sci-fi comedy, Detention is the sort of film you either think is genius, or overloaded and trying too hard. With tonnes of allusions to the genre it has the self-reflectiveness of its clear influence, Scream, but also has a lot more to it narratively than the famous slasher comedy franchise. Hutcherson plays Clapton, one of a group of misfits at Grizzly Lake High. A serial killer known as Cinderhella is hunting down members of the student body, and the principal thinks it’s one of the strange kids he’s kept in detention until 10pm on prom night. Just when you think the plot is going one way, it turns into a story about a time machine and the fate of the world. Hutcherson and his co-stars are energetic, bringing a verve to their roles that make the film believable and compelling, but as Clapton, he is particularly magnetic and sympathetic.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>5. Tragedy Girls</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=720 data-current-count=1020 data-injectable=true>Hutcherson sure loves a comedy slasher, but this 2017 film is one of his best both in terms of the actual movie and his performance. It follows two teens who run a true crime blog called “Tragedy Girls” who are so desperate to gain followers they begin committing murders of their own, using a famous serial killer as a fall guy. Hutcherson plays Toby, one of the girls’ former boyfriends and part-time antagonist to the pair. He ends up getting more followers than them as a result of their schemes, which spells trouble for him later down the line. Although he’s only in Tragedy Girls for a short period of time, he’s a brilliant screen presence, and adds a bit of star power to the film.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>4. Journey to the Center of the Earth</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=750 data-current-count=1050 data-injectable=true>Jules Verne’s famous 19th century sci-fi novel has been adapted countless times, but this 2008 version had Hutcherson putting in a great performance as Sean, the teen who’s been foisted upon his scientist uncle (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Brendan Fraser</a>) as the latter embarks on a trip to Iceland. A bit of a meta story, the plot of the film is actually about the idea that Verne’s novel was a real account, so it isn’t quite an exact remake like many of the others. The film itself is pretty entertaining, and is perfect for a rainy afternoon when you want action, adventure, and heart. Hutcherson is great as the inquisitive and surprisingly resourceful nephew, and his performance was definitely a sign of things to come with regards to his talent.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>3. Howl’s Moving Castle</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=652 data-current-count=952 data-injectable=true>This Studio Ghibli classic is considered to be one of legendary filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki’s best, with its stunning blend of wonder, beauty, and emotion. A truly brilliant cinematic achievement, the story follows Sophie, a teen turned into an old woman after a witch places a curse on her. The haggard Sophie heads to the wizard Howl’s flying castle, where she meets a cast of intriguing characters including Markl (Hutcherson in the English language dub of the film). The actor is fantastic as Howl’s young apprentice, and brings a lot of heart and charm to the role, only adding to the warm feeling that Ghibli films always give off.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>2. Bridge to Terabithia</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=790 data-current-count=1090 data-injectable=true>Widely considered to be one of Hutcherson’s most exciting and engaging early performances, Bridge to Terabithia is just a great watch in general, aided by its young star’s brilliance. He stars as Jess, a lonely fifth grader who finds a new friend in another loner. They create a fantasy world known as Terabithia, where they encounter all sorts of incredible creatures and animals, and soon it becomes a place of refuge for them and other kids they meet along the way. However, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">tragedy strikes</a>, allowing Hutcherson to display a range and depth of emotion that many adults couldn’t manage, let alone a child actor as he was at the time. Beautiful, poignant, and a real delight to watch, this film is all about friendship and love, and will hit you in the best possible way.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>1. The Hunger Games</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=626 data-current-count=926 data-injectable=false>This franchise, based on the best-selling book series of the same name, is what shot Hutcherson into superstardom. He starred alongside Jennifer Lawrence as Peeta, where they played the roles of two teen tributes selected to take part in a brutal ceremony <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">known as the Hunger Games</a>. Over the course of four films, the pair fight and survive in increasingly brutal circumstances, all while attempting to overthrow the dystopian forces that rule their world. Hutcherson is fantastic alongside Lawrence, and really deserves plaudits for his consistently great performances in the franchise. A must-watch for any fan of the actor.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S3sL%2FHZp%2BurJOdsrO%2FzqeqZpqVqMFuuc6voJ6rXaeur7fEnWY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
